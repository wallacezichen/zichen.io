## Projects 💻

**WeRide Application**<br>
[Backend](https://github.com/wallacezichen/weRide-backend), [Frontend](https://github.com/wallacezichen/weRide-reactNative), [UX](https://www.figma.com/file/CnP646LYZOvRwxTC7HiZuM/ui-design-before-enter-home-page?node-id=0%3A1&t=E1KfSTgFT0cXhYCJ-0)<br>
WeRide is a carpool application that seeks to make commuting to campus cheaper, safer, and more convenient. For the drivers, the system will match them with riders on their way to school, they will be paid by the application for the calculated gas money and other small costs. For riders, the system will show them the brief profile of student drivers for them to select on the route to school. The cost will be much lower than uber/lyft and faster than waiting for shuttles/trains. 


**[Find Calories](https://wallacezichen.github.io/Find_the_Calories/)**<br>
A machine learning research conducted by me and [Hyunsoo Jeon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyunsoo-jeon-808kr/). We aimed at predicting the calorie content of recipes based on factors other than the primary macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrates) while addressing data cleaning, model exploration, and fairness analysis and performing Permutation Test.

**[Exclaimation Marks Lead To Satisfaction](https://lionjhs98.github.io/exclamation-mark-shows-satisfaction/)**<br>
A machine learning research conducted by me and [Hyunsoo Jeon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyunsoo-jeon-808kr/). We aimed to address the question that "Does the usage of exclamation mark ! in the review and description give the recipes higer rating?"
