## Projects 💻

**WeRide Application**<br>
[Backend](https://github.com/wallacezichen/weRide-backend), [Frontend](https://github.com/wallacezichen/weRide-reactNative), [UX](https://www.figma.com/file/CnP646LYZOvRwxTC7HiZuM/ui-design-before-enter-home-page?node-id=0%3A1&t=E1KfSTgFT0cXhYCJ-0)<br>
A carpool application that seeks to make commuting to campus cheaper, safer, and more convenient. For the drivers, the system will match them with riders on their way to school, they will be paid by the application for the calculated gas money and other small costs. For riders, the system will show them the brief profile of student drivers for them to select on the route to school. The cost will be much lower than uber/lyft and faster than waiting for shuttles/trains. 

**Find Doctors**<br>
An application for users to find doctors around them. Allow users to make appointment with doctor, real time chat, and check doctors detail information. This app is built using MERN stack and deploy using AWS lambda. Still in progress...

**Word Hunt Solver**<br>
An application offers an edge to gamers playing Gamepigeon's Word Hunt by enabling them to input their available characters and generate the longest possible words they can form. Still in progress...

**[Find Calories](https://wallacezichen.github.io/Find_the_Calories/)**<br>
A machine learning research conducted by me and [Hyunsoo Jeon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyunsoo-jeon-808kr/). We aimed at predicting the calorie content of recipes based on factors other than the primary macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrates) while addressing data cleaning, model exploration, and fairness analysis and performing Permutation Test.

**[Exclaimation Marks Lead To Satisfaction](https://lionjhs98.github.io/exclamation-mark-shows-satisfaction/)**<br>
A machine learning research conducted by me and [Hyunsoo Jeon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyunsoo-jeon-808kr/). We aimed to address the question that "Does the usage of exclamation mark ! in the review and description give the recipes higer rating?"

**[Analyzing And Predicting Popularity Trends Spotify Songs](https://wallacezichen.github.io/zichen.io/assets/pdf/Assignment2_report.pdf)**<br>
A research report analyzed a dataset of 30,000 Spotify songs, focusing on predicting track popularity, utilized ensemble learning techniques, particularly AdaBoost Regression. The study improved predictive accuracy from a baseline MAE of 20.154 to 9.375 through feature engineering and model selection.
